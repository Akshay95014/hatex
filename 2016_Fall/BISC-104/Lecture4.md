Triglycerides -> 3 fatty acids
Dehydration reactions also produce triglycerides

Phsopholipids are another type of lipids. Cell membrane => bilayer of phospholipds
Tail non polar, head polar


Unsaturated lipids -> Bent tails -> liquid at room temperature


Cholestrol -> Pre-cursor to lot of osteroids(osterogen, testesterone)


## Proteins
- Contain C,H,O
- Provide structural support
- Mechanism for moving muscles
- Function in physiological proceses
- Strength issues
- Transport substances in the blood

## Enzymes:
- Type pf protein
- Speedup chemical reactions
- E.g Digestive enzymes catalyze hydrolysis of bonds in food molecules
- Speicifc to substrate


## Defensie Proteins
- Protection against disease

## Storage Proteins

- Storage of amino acids
- Casein = makor source of AA for baby mammals. Plants stire in seeds. Ovaluv

## Transport protein

- Transport of substances
- E.g Haemoglobin - Carries 

## HArmonola proteins
- Coordination of organisms activities
- Insulin regulates hhihig blod sugar

## Receptor Proteins
- Response of'cell to 

## Contractive and motor proteins
- Movement
- motor proteins regulate movement;. of  cilia and f=k

## Strucutkra Porii-
- Support

- Amino acids are building blocs of proteini
- 20 different AA
- Amino acid
    - Centrod carbod with 4 groups
        - H
        - AMino group(NH2)
        - Carboxyl
        - Radical group or side chain(R)

    R group determines activity of the AA
- AA join by forming peptide bond(dehydration reaction)
- AA-AA is a dipeptide
- All proteins are polypeptides
- Folding and interation of adjacent AA determines shape of protein
- Primary -> Secondary -> Tertiary -> Quaternary structur
- Shpe of prptein determines function, final shape determined by primary structure

## Enzymes

- Facilititates reaction without changing themselves
- Rely on shape to function properly
