Nucleic Acids -> C,H,O,N,Phosphorous 

Two tyoes:
  - Deoxyribose
    - Sugar - deoxyribose
    - A,T,G,C
    - double stranded
  - Ribose
    - Sugar - ribose
    - T -> U
    
  Gene expression: DNA -> RNA -> Protein
  
DNA -> mRNA -> transported to cytoplasm from nucleus -> Ribosome attached to mRNA when in cytoplasm 
-> Protein

## Life requires energy

Long term storage => 
Short term storage => ATP Adenosine tri phosphate (Energy comes from aTP Sybthesis through dehydration reaction) 


Cells:Biology:: Atoms:Chemistry

Cell is highly organized structure, has three basic parts

 - Barrier plasma membrane
 - Nucleus
 - Fluid called cytosol located between plasma membrane and nucleus
 
Secretory vesicles -> Secrete 

NOTE: I missed a LOT of POINTS on the organelles slide! Need to look it up again.

Endplasmic Reticulum -> Rough ER -> have ribosomes
