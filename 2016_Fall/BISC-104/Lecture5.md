Nucleic Acids -> C,H,O,N,Phosphorous 

Two tyoes:
  - Deoxyribose
    - Sugar - deoxyribose
    - A,T,G,C
    - double stranded
  - Ribose
    - Sugar - ribose
    - T -> U
    
  Gene expression: DNA -> RNA -> Protein
  
DNA -> mRNA -> transported to cytoplasm from nucleus -> Ribosome attached to mRNA when in cytoplasm 
-> Protein

## Life requires energy

Long term storage => 
- Glycogn in muscle and liver
- triglycerides packed into storage cells adipocytes
Short term storage => ATP Adenosine tri phosphate (Energy comes from aTP Sybthesis through dehydration reaction) 


Cells:Biology:: Atoms:Chemistry

Cell is highly organized structure, has three basic parts

 - Barrier plasma membrane
 - Nucleus
 - Fluid called cytosol located between plasma membrane and nucleus
 
Secretory vesicles -> Secrete 


Endplasmic Reticulum -> Rough ER -> have ribosomes

- Nucleus - DNA located
- Cytoplasm - All activites except those in nucleus
- Rough ER -> Glycoprotein syntheis
- Smooth ER -> Fatty acid and steroid
- Ribosome -> Protein synthesis
- Golgi -> Accepts proteins from rough ER, stores packages and export proteins
- Mitochondrion -> ATP Synthesis
- Lysosomes -> Fuses with and digests contents of vesicles
- Centrioles -> organizing enter for microtubules and mitotic spindle[x]
- microvili : folded part that increase cell area(outside plasma membrane)


Cell membrane -> two layer of phopholipds with intersperesed proteins, fats sugars
- hydrophilic centers are oritened towards aqueous env both inside and outside
- hydrophobic part sandwitched between center
- proteins and lipids associated with cell membrane have sugars attached to external surface: glycoproteins ; glycolipids
- Membrane is semipermeable: active or passive movement
- Active movement requires energy
- Simple diffusion: passive [just due to conc gradient]
- Osmosis: diffusion through selectively permeable membrane : Water diffusing through towards higher conc of solute
- Concept of hyper(more solute), hypo (less solute), iso(equal solute) osmotic
- Tonicity: Ability of a surrounding solution to cause a cell to gain/lose water
- Hypertonic: Solute conc. higher outside(because the solution is hypertonic) -> cell loses water
- Hypotonic: Solute conc. low outisde -> cell gains water
-

## osmosis

- water cannot travel through plasma membrane so transport happens through proteins
- hypotonic soln -> cell bursts
- hypertonic soln -> cell shrivesl up

- energy required to move solute against conc gradient

Actice transport accounts for:
- uptake of digested nutrients from small intenstine
- concentrating of iodine in thyroid[make sense now]

Reciprocal pump:
- Remove one thing while pumping other
- Example: Na+/K+ pump

Endo and Exo cytosis:
- Endo: extracellular particles taken into the cell via vesicle formation
- exo: used to remove secretory products


Cytoskeleton: bones of cell
- Intermediate filaments -> protect cells from mechanical stress
- Micortubule: hollowcylinders made od tubulin protein
- microfilaments: actin => cellular locomotion, muscle contraction, cell division
