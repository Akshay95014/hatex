Nucleic Acids -> C,H,O,N,Phosphorous 

Two tyoes:
  - Deoxyribose
    - Sugar - deoxyribose
    - A,T,G,C
    - double stranded
  - Ribose
    - Sugar - ribose
    - T -> U
    
  Gene expression: DNA -> RNA -> Protein
  
DNA -> mRNA -> transported to cytoplasm from nucleus -> Ribosome attached to mRNA when in cytoplasm 
-> Protein
