## Gastrulation to vertrebrae

- ventral scells give rice to sclerotome which forms the skeletal system of vertrebrae
- Signals come from notochord
- Sclerotome -> divide and migrate and surrond neural tube and then they start to differentuate -> first form cartillage
- notchord --> intervertebral disc

- How do you mkae different vertevrae?
  - There are 7 cervical different from 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral
  
- Vertebrae
  - Repeating patten of same shape, relatize size
  
  - Fly mutatnts for segmental patterning
  - antennapedia -- thoracic
  - Order of genes --> accodring to body plan
  - Homoedomain -> Hox genes have can only be identifyed in conjunction with metazoan evolution
  - amphioxus - no vertrebral column
  
  -- IF H10 is removed H10 Lumbar will take over the thoracic activity
  
  -- If developmental process is aprocess where segmentation is part, then Hox genes
