## Quiz-3 Answers

1. Trafectoderm cell mass -> gives rise to major parts of placenta. Fetus is not discarded during pregnancy. Not all embryos will
generate the fetus. Fetus is post implantation product.

3. siRNA has no nuclease, but an RNA homologus to a section and does RNA-RNA binding. Can also lead to attenuation of 
translation

6. CARM1 is not a tf ad it does not bind to DNA

#### "Ex Ov Omni" L Everything comes out of an egg: -- William Harvey 1651
- Parthogenesis: reproduction without fertilization
- Can this jappen in mammals?
- Aristotle: "epigenesis" -- progressive development of the organism
- "Preformation": -- Looking down the microscopes Van Leuweenhoek -- saw miniature preformed humans
- Development initiated on fertilization of eff by sperm
- Primordial germ cells lie outside in the yolk sac  in the primitive endoderm and goes to gonads (testers/ovaries)
 pre sexual differentiation. They give rise exclusively to egg or sperm. All other cell types make up soma
-

- Development of sperm happens in testes -- STart swith 46 chromosomes -> Divide with first meiotic division to give
 23X+23X and 23Y+23Y . This will each result in 4 haploid cells
- oocyte --> one of follices will get starting begire . In between goes under meoptoc division to reduce
46 XX to two 23X. But only one nucleus remains. So there is one to one mapping.
- It is actually the environment that 
- Y chromosome has genes on it that make it essential for making sperm
- If you move an oocyty(XX) into the testes, it will not geneerat sperms. But if you insert $XY$ spermocyte into ovary, 
 it will generate aviable oocyte (containing X as Y will be chucked out)

## Mitosis vs Meiosis

- Mitosis: each chromosome pair replicates -> align across mitotic spindlr -? replicated chromatids separate two poles
- Meiosis : Due to recombination events --> each cell is different
- Meiosis: If transpoases ends it could still be possible to chuck off portions affected by taransposases through recombination
- 
## Comparison of sperm and egg development
- Reduction of chromosome number by meiosis : 46 to 23
- males Make a half a trillion sperm
- Around 5 months of fetal development femake have germ cells????

Maturation of sperm:

- Centriole of cell -- enables chromosome to align during mitosis --> no mitotic spindle created
- Acrosome developmed from Golgi apparatus
- Nucleus makes the first contact with egg
- Only thing sperm introudces into the egg is its dna. So mitochondira is from mother alwasys


Oocyte -> fertilized egg
- Polar body
- Simulate progrestron.
-  Fertlser: When so sperm goes close to egg, dues to biochemical prference
