Cas9 - Double strand breaks
Guide RNA - Sequence speicifc finding, recruit CAS9

Longer regions of homology for insertion

Specificity in insertion of GFP  -> Arms should be homologous -> The longer these arms -> Higher chances of biniding

guideRNA + Cas9 -> requires palindromic site -> Should be of type NGG

Q5. Two introns with one exon -> Exon2 will be chucked out by non homologousm or it will cleav target2/target1


## Experimental approaches to analyze development, maintenance, and repair processes

- FACs - Fluroscence activated cell sorting 
- Stem cell for bllod -. hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
- Individual blood systems -> limited life span -> But remaking cells for many years all of donor type ->
Must be one or more stem cell types repopulating the blood --> How to identify live cells?
- Live cells: Can the cells reconstitute the hemapoietic stem cell system?
- How would you know that right cells were being enriched? You have live cells -> require fewer and fewer cells to
reconstitute whole blood system
- Stem Cells -> Individual or as a popsulation can produce differentiated progeny and reproduce themselves

If you label proteins on surface of cell -> That is viable

FACs:

- Fluroscent antibody binds to surface of cells
- In cell sorter, channel through the nozlle contains all type of cells
- Fluosrescent group gives negative charge so it is attraced to the positive field
- Use specificity of antibodies towards surface proteins to separate certain cells from others
- Can be used to separate different populations based on intensity level of flurosence 

In hemaotpoetic transpant, a lot needs to be transplanted because the probability of individual cell proliferating
is low
